    "Last week you implemented your first MapReduce Algorithm using a bash script framework. We saw that adding a sorting component to our framework allowed us to write a more efficient reducer script and perform word counting in parallel. In this notebook, we'll introduce a new framework: Hadoop Streaming. Like before, you'll write mapper and reducer scripts in python then pass them to the framework which will stream over your input files, split them into chunks and sort to your specification. Although Hadoop Streaming is rarely used in production anymore it is the precursor to systems like Spark and as such is a useful way to illustrate key concepts in parallel computation. By the end of this live session you should be able to:\n",
    "* __... describe__ the main components and default behavior of the Hadoop Streaming framework.\n",
    "* __... write__ a Hadoop MapReduce job from scratch.\n",
    "* __... access__ the Hadoop Streaming UI and use it in debugging your jobs.\n",
    "* __... design__ Hadoop MapReduce implementations for simple tasks like counting and ordering.\n",
    "* __... explain__ why sorting with multiple reducers requires some extra work (as opposed to sorting with a single reducer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Hadoop Streaming syntax is very particular. Make sure to test your python scripts before passing them to the Hadoop job and pay careful attention to the order in which Hadoop job parameters are specified."

    "__INSTRUCTOR TALKING POINTS__\n",
    "* What is MapReduce? How does it differ from Hadoop?\n",
    "> MapReduce is a programming model for processing large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. It has two phases: 'map' which applies a transformation(or filter) to all elements of a collection, and 'reduce' which aggregates/folds the elements of a collection. The term \"MapReduce\" is also commonly used to refer to an execution framework built around this paradigm. Hadoop MapReduce is one such popular open-source framework.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the main ideas of the functional programming paradigm and how does MapReduce exemplify these ideas?\n",
    "> Hadoop MapReduce is based on the functional programing paradigm. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function. Key ideas in this paradigm include avoiding state changes/mutable data, and using higher-order functions (functions which take other functions as inputs. Map and reduce are examples of higher-order functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the basic data structure used in Hadoop MapReduce?\n",
    ">Hadoop MapReduce processes data in key-value pairs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What does 'data/code co-location' mean? How does this principle contribute to the efficiency of a distributed computation?\n",
    "> Data/code \"colocation\" is a principle in distributed processing by which we send the code to the node where a chunk of data is stored and perform the computation on that node. This is efficient because it limits network traffic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is a race condition in the context of parallel computation? Give an example.\n",
    "> A race condition happens when multiple execution entities (e.g. threads, processes, etc) are accessing or modifying the same resource at the same time, and the order of access can impact the result. For example, suppose two concurrent threads or processes A and B attempt to increment the same memory location. Without proper synchronization, chances are that the following sequence will occur: A reads, B reads, A writes, B writes - with the final value being incremented only once. To overcome this conditon, the global/count variable must be locked during the update; otherwise a thread can read the count while other threads are updating it, and the final accumulation will be less than the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What kind of _synchronization_ does Hadoop MapReduce perform by default? \n",
    "> Hadoop MapReduce performs synchronization using a barrier between the map and reduce phases. The reduce phase will not start until all mappers are complete. Then Hadoop reorganizes (a.k.a. 'shuffles') the mapper output which will be input to the reduce phase which will receive records sorted by key. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What aspect of the synchronization process is computationally costly?\n",
    "> This 'shuffle' is computationally costly because of the sorting and network transfer involved.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* What does Hadoop sort by? What is Hadoop's default sort order? \n",
    "> By default, hadoop sorts by key in alpha-numeric order. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Throughout this course we'll emphasize the goal of writing 'stateless' implementations? What does that mean?\n",
    "> We don't want our implementations to depend on any shared mutable information. This is related to the idea of avoiding race conditions & the optimality of 'embarassingly parallel' implementations. Note that we also like to limit the use of memory given that we are likely using a cluster of cheap machines that may have limited space.... but that in-memory aggregation on individual nodes is not a violation of the principle of 'statelessness' (though it might seem like we are storing a 'state' in that scenario, the 'statefulness' that we want to avoid is any shared information that needs to be updated across multiple nodes.)"

    "# Breakout 1: WordCount in Hadoop MapReduce\n",
    "For most of the Hadoop jobs you write this week, you will use python scripts similar to those you wrote in HW1 to serve as your mapper and reducer. Since the Hadoop Streaming framework implements the principle of data/code co-location, we'll need to provide the paths to these python scripts so that Hadoop can ship them to the nodes where the code will get run. We do this by adding an additional flag to the Hadoop streaming command: the `-files` parameter. This will be the first of a number of additional flags that you can added to your Hadoop Streaming jobs to specify how the framework should handle your data. __`TIP:`__ _Hadoop can be very particular about the order in which you specify optional configuration fields. As a good debugging practice we recommend that you always maintain working code by starting with a basic job like the one we provided above and then testing the command as you add or modify parameters one by one_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your first breakout activity we've provided an example of a Hadoop MapReduce job that performs word counting on an input file of your choice. The mapper and reducer are python scripts provided at __`WordCount/mapper.py`__ and __`WordCount/reducer.py`__. The Hadoop Streaming command is in a cell below. As you read through the example and go on to write your own Hadoop MapReduce jobs you may want to refer to Michael Noll's [blogpost on writing an MapReduce job](http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/) and/or the [Hadoop Streaming documentation](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.5/hadoop-streaming/HadoopStreaming.html)."

Note that they (briefly) explain what the script does and the expected input/output record formats. [`HINT`: _docstrings are a way to record information to help your reader (future-self/collaborator/grader) quickly orient to a piece of code. They should describe_ __what__  (_not_ how) _is being done. For more information refer to the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)_] The use of docstrings is recommended in all code that is written for this class.\n",

How will you expect Hadoop to sort the records emitted by the mapper script? Why is this order important given how the reducer script is written?\n",

You will need to do these preparation steps for all future Hadoop MapReduce jobs.\n",
    "\n",

    "* __d) unit test:__ A good habit when writing Hadoop streaming jobs is to test your mappers and reducers locally before passing them to a Hadoop streaming command. An easy way to do this is to pipe in a small line of text. We've provided the unix code to do so and added a unix sort to mimic Hadoop's default sorting. Run these cells to confirm that our mapper and reducer work properly. (Observe how the reducer doesn't work without the sort).\n",

Read through this command and be sure you understand each parameter that we're passing in, then run it and confirm that the output performs word counting correctly. Finally, modify the code provided to run the Hadoop MapReduce job on the _Alice and Wonderland_ text instead of the test file. Remember that the input path you pass to the Hadoop streaming command should be a location in HDFS not a local path. Take a look at the output and confirm you get the same count for 'alice' as in HW1. Food for thought: _does the sorting match what you expected?_ "

Hadoop will sort the records alphabetically by key (in our case, the word). This is important because the reducer will stream over the input records and emit the sum of consecutive counts (that belong to the same word). If the records were not alphabetized then the reducer might emit the same word twice without fully adding up its occurences.\n",

    "    * __`Two important warnings:`__  1) Parameters starting with the `-D` flag must come immediately after the line where you specify the jar file and before the parameters `-files`, `-mapper`, etc; 2) The options we provided you above specify a reverse numeric sort on the second field and tie breaking using the first field... but the mapper you wrote in part a switched the order of the words and the counts. You will need to make a small adjustment to the options we provided so that it instead reverse numerically sorts by the first field and breaks ties on the second. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code + discussion:__ Run your Hadoop job one more time but this time add the parameter to specify that the job should use 2 reduce tasks instead of 1. For convenience of illustration, you should do this using the sample counts file instead of the full _Alice_ text. \n",
    "    * Something is wrong with the results. Use the provided code to look at the output of each partition independently. Discuss why our results are off.  \n",
    "    * Imagine we had a really large file and performed a sort using 100 partitions, what post processing would we have to do to get a fully ordered list (Total Order Sort)? Compare the computational cost of this postprocessing to the postprocessing we discussed in the VocabSize job."

    "# Breakout 5: Tracking Down Errors in Python Code\n",
    "You've now seen most of the basic functionality of writing and running Hadoop streaming jobs. In this week's homework and over the course of the next few weeks we'll explore additional options and tricks to add to our jobs. As we do this you will want to be able to quickly distinguish between errors that occur due to a mistake in your algorithm design or Hadoop streaming command and errors that are rooted in your Python code. Unfortunately the error logs printed to console do not always make this distinction obvious. Luckily, the Hadoop UI logs do make it very easy to identify Python coding errors. Before you move on to the homework (even if there isn't time in class) we'd like to make sure you know where to find these logs and how to fix two common mistakes. __Below, we provided code that contains two common errors for you to debug. Your job is to:__\n",
    "1. __Run the provided code as is, it will throw an error.__\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Navigate to the Hadoop UI and find the relevant logs explaining your error.__ \n",
    " * Under `Task Type`, click `Map` > `task_XXXXXX` >`logs`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Fix the error(s) and re-run the job__. \n",
    "\n",
    "__`NOTE 1:`__ There are two different kinds of errors in the mapper code. See the inline comments for specific fixes: one involves adding a parameter to your Hadoop job the other two you must fix in the mapper code (re-run that cell to overwrite the old mapper). I'd recommend fixing them one at a time so that you can see how the logs and error messages change depending on the type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`NOTE 2:` If you do not get to this section in class, you still must complete it before beginning the homework!__"
